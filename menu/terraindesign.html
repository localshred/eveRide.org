<h2>Do you have an idea of something that you'd love 
to session?</h2>
<h4>Let us know what it is! Chances are, we'll probably build it for you 
and put it in the first everpark!</h4>

<p>We want this to be a park for the people, by the people... so naturally we want the people to design our terrain! Let your imagination go wild with this! Draw up or describe whatever you think would be fun to ride, scan it, and <a href="upload_f.php?var=terrain">send it</a> to us. 
Boxes, rails, pipe features, jumps, tubing runs, whatever! We're not kidding when we say we want the most revolutionary terrain at the everparks, and we want your help to make it that way! There is nothing too wild!</p>

<p>Some examples are shown below of a few basic sketches.</p>

<p class="fineprint">Submitted designs will become property of eveRide. There is no guarantee that we will use all submitted terrain designs in the everparks. However, the chances are pretty good since we want them to be made by the people, for the people.</p>
