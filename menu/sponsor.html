      <td width="60%">When I originally thought of how I could 
      fund the eveRide cause I was considering getting funds from venture 
      capitalists, banks, and selling out to ski-resorts. But who would that 
      help? The entire time I would be held back by the decisions of others. The 
      VCs would tell me how to run things to make them more money. Nobody has 
      fun with banks, you've probably dealt with them before. And the ski-resort 
      idea? That would kill the whole root of why I wanted to make this thing in 
      the first place.<p>eveRide will never be about money. I figured eveRide could support some awesome humanitarian programs and reward supporting businesses while still making the everparks. I 
      had no idea who or why anybody would donate enough to fund the parks though, especially when there was 
      really nothing in it for them but a pat on the back and maybe a free t-shirt.</p>
      <p>Thank heaven for PBS. While channel surfing I crossed one of those rad 
      nature shows they put on there about ants, and at the end it showed some 
      commercials for their &quot;proud sponsors.&quot; They also thanked all the viewers 
      like me. Why couldn't eveRide be like that? Well, it can!</td>

    <td width="60%">You know on PBS they show a short commercial 
    provided by their sponsor? You'll get the same. With the revolutionary 
    terrain and ideas behind the everparks, there are sure to be plenty of 
    people hitting those slopes. If you haven't seen what the everparks are 
    all about we strongly recommend you to <a href="winterpark_f.php">check it out</a>. We want our sponsors to 
    be heard by these masses! Here are some things we'll do for our sponsors:
	<ol>
<li><b>Put you on the pass! </b>We are planning to make a 
      membership card for the everparks. We'll put our top 
      sponsors on them! Riders will be able to get them in only a few places: 
      online and at sponsoring businesses. Get the target market into your store by 
      carrying these passes! Have them show their pass to get discounts on your goods. Our sponsors will have access to personal information gathered with the passes, and will be able to advertize direct through email, mailings, and heaven forbid the phone. If you want to know more 
      about the EverPass feel free to <a href="contact_f.php?sel=general">contact us</a>.</li>

<li><b>Demo-stands on demand</b>. Although magazine ads, 
      banners, TV commercials, radio spots, and internet banners are all 
      effective ways to spread the word about your product, sometimes buyers 
      need to feel, touch, smell, taste, try, and ride what you're selling. They 
      can get to know the quality of your product first hand when they demo or 
      sample it. We'll give you access to on-hill product kiosks where riders 
      can 'test drive' what you're selling.</li>


      <li><b>Name rails, jumps, and other terrain after your 
      business.</b> Say we put your banner on a rail. From then on, that rail is 
      naturally named after your company by the riders.</li>
      <li><b>Display an array of banners in places where they 
      will be recognized</b>. We'll hang them overhead, put them on our fences, 
      gates, lifts, buildings, equipment, our <a href="winterpark_f.php#wgg"> white glove groomers</a> and anywhere else you might want them.</li>
      <li><b>Web site banner space</b>. If your organization has 
      a website you want your market to see and would like a banner on the 
      eveRide homepage, it's done!</li>
