<h2>Donate and get stuff!</h2>
<p>You heard right! When you donate to the eveRide cause you get stuff!</p>

Here's how it works! When you donate to the eveRide cause, we'll hook you up with eveRide and everpark merchandise! Here's what happens when you donate:

<ul type="disc">
<li>You get cool stuff like stickers, T-shirts, beanies, baseball hats, hoodies, jackets, and more!</li>
<li>Every little bit helps. 100% of donations go directly to the eveRide cause and building the everparks. The sooner the parks are built, the better! Find out more about where the donations will go to.</li>
<li>You show our sponsors that you are willing to put a little down for the cause. The sponsors see this and know that eveRide has support through the people, by the people.</li>
<li>By wearing the stuff you get and putting the stickers on your cars, boards, skis, etc, you let more people know about eveRide and the everparks. It's like a chain reaction, the the more people that get stoked,  the more the sponsors contribute! And the more they contribute, the quicker the everparks are built! The quicker the parks are built, the quicker we can start giving back to the community!</li>
<li>You don't have to donate to show support for eveRide. By simply entering a photo or t-shirt design into one of our contests, taking a survey, submitting some terrain, giving feedback, or signing the stoked list you can show our sponsors that you are down for the cause. If you don't have any money, don't worry! That's what the everparks are for (remember the tickets will cost less than half of what most resorts charge!) But please support eveRide however you can! We want to ride the everparks just as much as you do!</li>
</ul>

<h2>eveRide and everpark Merch!</h4>

<p><em>Pictures of the merch below should be coming soon. If we don't have a picture, then most likely you can't order it, because we probably don't have it yet. Check back often for more updates</em></p>

<p><font style="title"><strong>The eveRide/everpark Sticker Pack</strong></font><br>
Packed with different kinds of sticker goodness. Put 'em on your cars, equipment, and anything else that wouldn't be considered vandalizing. Get the goods with a donation of five bucks.</p>

<p><font style="title"><strong>The eveRide or everpark Beanie</strong></font><br>
We currently aren't offering these because it's summer... you don't need a beanie.</p>

<p><font style="title"><strong>The eveRide ghetto-tastic T-shirt</strong></font><br>
These are good lookin' shirts! Not really... but they spread the word! Basically you can pick and choose what you want in the 'special order' spot when you click the 'buy this crap' button. Most likely what you buy will be pretty nasty and smell like paint, since we stencil these badboys out ourselves. Shirts will be white unless you specify a different color. Sizes S-M-L-XL. Get these mamma-jammas for a donation of twelve bucks.</p>

<p><font style="title"><strong>The eveRide or everpark Baseball Cap</strong></font><br>
These hats will be sick! We're currently looking for a supplier, but they'll be here soon!</p>

<p><font style="title"><strong>The eveRide or everpark Hoodie</strong></font><br>
These hooded sweatshirts are going to be awesome. Again, we've got to find a supplier before we can offer these, and besides that, it's summer.</p>

<p><font style="title"><strong>The eveRide or everpark Jacket</strong></font><br>
Again: supplier, summer. These will also shred the gnar.</p>
