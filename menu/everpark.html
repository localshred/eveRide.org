      <td width="60%">An everpark is different than the regular snowpark in a few ways. The idea is basically the same, but the roots are completely different.<br>As you know, almost all snowparks are located within ski resorts. Ski Resorts these days seem to be all about making suitcases full of cash and building five star hotels and restaurants to make even more.<br>What about their snowriding roots? It seems like they're taking the 'ski' out of 'ski resort.' The average price of a day pass today is about $52.00! The snowriding youth of today can't afford that! The lines are usually long, the slopes are crowded, the terrain is neglected, the prices of food and services are high, and there's a lot of corporate politics going into the whole process. It's not about the people anymore, it's about <strong>money</strong>.<br>This is where everpark comes in. everparks are built by eveRide, a non-profit organization founded by a rag-tag team of snowboarder youth. The prices at an everpark will be less than half of what most resorts charge. eveRide won't be making resorts, restaurants, or hotels. We'd rather appeal to all the poor snowriding punks out there that just want to ride.</td>

We just keep them because nothing better has come along. Have you ever been stuck on a lift on a really cold day? What about really long lift lines? Have you ever hiked a rail or something because that's all you wanted to work on? Have you ever been tripped up while getting on or off a lift? Do your legs ever get sore while riding them? Have you ever fallen from a lift? Lifts are really expensive to operate. And what about the environmental damage? <br><br>Well, it's time for all that to change.<br>I can't tell you how it's done, but these "anti-lifts" are going to be dope. You can get on and off without removing any bindings whenever you want, they're totally comfortable, totally safe, and 9 out of 10 babes approve. They're less expensive to operate (which will keep the prices lower), they will move more people up the hill with smaller lines, and they won't scar the environment.

        rider is heading towards a big hit and a cute little kid in a puffy coat
        rides up the front of the kicker, then either slides back down or falls
        off the end. Not only is it dangerous for this little guy, but its
        dangerous to the rider as well. Two people lose in this situation. The
        advanced rider doesn't get to ride his favorite jump, and the little guy
        is in obvious danger.</td>

        be cut off by that little puffy coat? And if you are a parent, would you
        feel comfortable having your kids away from the "tuff shreds"

  <td width="60%">For now, the projections easily aren't set in stone. At the moment, research is being done on a few different locations for the first everpark. The most promising location looks to be in Utah, the center of snowriding in the U.S. All you need to know is that it's within an hour south of the Salt Lake City Airport, Park City, and the home of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. Needless to say it gets plenty of the Greatest Snow on Earth. As more studies are done, we'll get more specific on where the first everpark will be built. For now we're putting together a little <a href="beta_f.php">beta project</a> for this winter. It's invite-only, and it's not going to be anything huge... but it's a start. We'll have pictures up this winter.</td>
