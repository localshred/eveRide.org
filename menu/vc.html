  <td width="60%">The future looks bright for the snowriding industry. I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I'm really excited to get the ball rolling on this thing. I take a step back and look at what its all about and I just feel good. eveRide and the everparks are helping people do what they love without taking advantage of them. Snowriding businesses will get a big bonus for having so much exposure through their sponsorships. Surplus funds to the everparks will be put back into the communities that support them, not to mention the other humanitarian programs it'll support. None of us (the founders) are in this to get rich, we really see this as an opportunity to help people out, promote the snowriding industry, and (to be completely honest) have a sick snowpark to ride whenever we want. You can't put a price-tag on a smooth grind, huge air, or just the all-around experience of the perfect day in the park.</td>

  <td width="60%">You know how ski resorts build all those huge hotels, fancy restaurants, and plush villages? Every bit of extra money they make from their off-the-wall day-pass prices gets jammed into real estate. We plan to do things a little different. We're going to give it to those who need it. I think I'll sleep better at night knowing that the extra funds generated by the everparks aren't stuffed under my mattress, but rather going into medical research, youth programs, and humanitarian efforts all over the world. It kinda makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside knowing that extra cash will be giving a starving child a meal, a cancer patient some hope, or a troubled punk kid a future. Yeah... suddenly money doesn't seem so important.<br>
So now that I'm off my soapbox, I'll tell you where we plan on putting the extra funds left over from covering expenses and making everparks the best snowparks in the world.</td>

I believe that a little bit can go a long way... or a little bit can be squandered for next-to-nothing. For instance, have you seen those commercials to help a starving kid in Guatemala or somewhere? It only takes like 80 cents a day or something to keep that kid alive and give 'em a chance. Now let's figure the cost of a hotel room at a ski resort here in Utah. The suites and penthouses I checked on didn't even have the prices listed. I did, however, find an overnight deal starting at $199. Through this rough calculation, you could stay at a hotel for a night or feed a starving child for 249 days. Say that hotel was only a million bucks to build... that calculates to feeding 1250 children for 1000 days each (approximately 2 years and 9 months). See how that works? A little bit can go a long way, or be squandered for next to nothing.<br>
Let's say you have a huge plate of food in front of you filled with everything you like. Now lets say that you chow down until you are satisfied... and look! There's still stuff left! So here's the question, you are already full... but do you eat the rest?<br>
Since you are reading this right now you obviously have access to the Internet. This means you are in the upper percentile with the richest folks in the world. We have huge plates in front of us! We can eat until we are satisfied, and we will still have stuff left over to give! We can still snowride, live life comfortably, and  still have stuff left over. So let's give it to those who could use it!

<b>Question Guy</b>:How old are you?<br><b>Tyler</b>: 21.<br><b>Question Guy</b>:When did you start riding?<br><b>Tyler</b>: I've been riding for a while, I would just slide down little hills as a kid, but I guess my first time at a resort I was about 13.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: Do you ski or snowboard?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Snowboard.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: Are you any good?<br><b>Tyler</b>: I guess. I'm not pro or anything, but I'm not too shabby.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: What's your favorite trick you've done?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Maybe a 360 pivot on our homemade rainbow? I dunno.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: Right on. What's your favorite type of terrain, rails?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Yeah, that and jumps. Nothing beats cruising with your buddies doing goonie stuff though.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: Easily. Besides snowboarding, what else do you like to do?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Uh... sleep? I play all kinds of sports. I used to skate a lot but my ankle's in bad shape so that's not much of an option. I like riding motorcycles and paintballing. Racquetball rips. I'm also kindof a computer nerd. Those are the main slams as of right now.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: What about the ladies?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Well, she's a rep and she's the ultimate babe... but she's in Idaho right now. Bummer.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: So how did you come up with this whole eveRide thing?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Well, I was driving with my dad on a trip to Idaho, and I just had the idea pop up in my head about the everparks. I wrote everything I thought of down on a napkin, and that's pretty much the beginning. It just kinda evolved after that.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: When did that happen?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Like, 2001?<br><b>Question Guy</b>: What makes you think you're the guy to do all this?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Because there are people that think I can't. That and it's been staring me in the face. If I didn't do it I'd let down my friends, the people this stuff will help, and mainly myself.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: Isn't that a lot of pressure?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Yeah... it's crazy to think that if this were to fall through everybody I know would see me as a failure. But it's not going to, so I don't really feel the crunch.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: So what do you do as the main founder?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Well, I've written the business plans, written most of the text on the website, designed the logos, researched a lot of stuff, come up with most of the ideas, and pretty much done a ton of work towards this. I guess I'm the final word on what goes down. That's what happens when it's been on your mind for two years.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: What do you think of the other guys?<br><b>Tyler</b>: They're awesome. I couldn't do this on my own, so I just surrounded myself with the best people for the job. They just happen to be my best friends. We have a lot of learning to do, and we're sure to get a few more people in the network to fill in where we're lacking.<br><b>Question Guy</b>: What is the best-case scenario for all this?<br><b>Tyler</b>: Honestly, just riding with my friends at an everpark we build and knowing that I've accomplished my goals and conquered my deamons. It's going to happen.

        <b>BJ</b>: Sittin' around in sweats.<br>
        <b>Question Guy</b>: When did you start riding?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: About seven years? I'm guessing about 7 years.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Snowboard?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: Yeah, I'm all about the uni-stick. Even though being 'all about' 
        something is lame according to Cody.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Who's Cody?<br>

		<b>Question Guy</b>: So how old are you?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: I'm 20.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Are you good at boarding?<br>
        <strong>BJ</strong>: Am I good at boarding?... my year to skill ratio 
        is horrible. But I still beat first years...<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: What's your best move?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: That I've landed?<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Yeah! Or nah...<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: I'd have to say my boardslide on the mailbox to broken collar bone. 
        But for real, 50-50 BS 180 out on our double barrel.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Sounds intense. That sucks about your collar bone.<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: Yeah I was pissed too.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: What's your favorite terrain?<br>
        <strong>BJ</strong>: I'd have to say rails or black diamonds/back country.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: What do you do when you're not on the slopes?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: Skating for sure. And designing this web site. And that's all.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: So how did you get involved in eveRide?<br>
        <strong>BJ</strong>: I've known Ty and Kevin since I was eight. Somewhere 
        inbetween playing Legos and Star Trek Card games, Ty came up with this 
        kooky idea. And neither of those guys know jack about making websites... 
        so I guess I'm the fall-guy.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: So you're the main web guy, eh?<br>
        <strong>BJ</strong>: Yeah, it's pretty nerdy.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: What is the best-case-scenario out of all of this?<br>
        <strong>BJ</strong>: That's kind of a dumb question. We'll build the everparks 
        and it'll be sick.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Any personal goals?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: I'd like to be better looking.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Rad... wouldn't we all. So plastic surgery? Maybe 
        some... &quot;modifications&quot;?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: Maybe plastic surgery... screw that I'm poor. I'm thinking I'll just 
        pretend I'm cool, and then people will think I'm good looking. But in 
        all actuality I really don't care.<br>
		<b>Question Guy</b>: Any last comments?<br>
		<strong>BJ</strong>: It gets me excited to know that everyone is getting so stoked about 
        eveRide. It amazes me that Tyler's ideas are so widely accepted, but I 
        think it's because not a lot of people have met him. But seriously, this 
        is a freaking rad idea, and we're going to help a lot of people out both 
        in the community and in the riding scene. The parks will be sick if I 
        have any say, so get stoked.</p>
