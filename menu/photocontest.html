<h2>Do you have a photo you'd like to share 
with the world?</h2>
<h4>We'd love to show off your pictures! Get exposure and just show people how sick you really are.</h4>

along with a caption. Winners will also be entered into a drawing to win free

<p>Here are some tips to score bonus points with the judges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pictures don't necessarily have to be of snow sports. 
  It's encouraged, but submit whatever your favorite pictures may be.</li>
  <li>Please keep it clean. Send us stuff that your mother 
  would approve of.</li>
  <li>Bonus points are given for creative outfits while 
  riding. (Like hot-pink body suits.) </li>
  <li>Make a caption telling us what you're doing and why you 
  are so awesome, or we'll make one for you.</li>
  <li>Please don't doctor your photos, keep it real.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to credit the photographer!</li>
  <li>Say "cheese!"</li>
</ul>
