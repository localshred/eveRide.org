  <td width="60%">Do you want to get started on the road to sponsorship? This is the place to start! Unlike other companies who sponsor riders to promote their product, we're not really looking for the best team right now, but rather the loudest. We want you to talk to EVERYBODY about eveRide. If your actions speak louder than your words, then that works just fine, too. If you can ride pretty well, and have good people skills, PLEASE apply. We want you to wear our label so much that we'd give the stuff to you. Don't expect free boards, skis, gear, or a paycheck... but you'll get free merchandise and recognition from other sponsors. They're the ones that will give you gear and money. So get on the road to sponsorship! To apply simply <a href="contact_f.php?sel=stoked">email us</a>. We'll tell you what to do in the email, but be prepared to send a video displaying how awesome you are with the social skills and on the slopes. Your job description is pretty much found in the "Represent" section below, except the eveRide team will get free stuff. <a href="#teamrep">Check out our team!</a></td>

When you become an eveRide rep, we'll give you eveRide and everpark stuff at cost, and then you can sell it for whatever you feel like and make some cash. You tell us what you want, we send it to you, and then you spread it around to everybody you see! You'll also be listed as a part of our team, and you'll get your own personal page of photos and information, along with some business cards. We'll hook you up with free stuff, let you come to <a href="beta_f.php">beta projects</a>, and do whatever we can for you. You'll also get dibs on being in the first batch of <a href="winterpark_f.php#wgg">white glove groomers</a> for the premier everpark. If you want to rep for us, <a href="contact_f.php?sel=stoked">click here</a> and send us an email. You don't even have to ride to be a rep, just as long as you <strong>raise your voice</strong>. We want YOU!</td>

Sell as much stuff as you can (stickers, shirts, beanies, hoodies, etc) because it spreads the word for us and makes cash for you.</td>
