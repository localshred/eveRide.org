<h2>Tell a Friend about eveRide and everpark</h2>

<p>So now you're finally stoked enough to let a buddy in on this radical idea, eh? That's awesome, because we need more people like you to help spread the word and get people stoked. This page will send an email to your bud letting them know about eveRide and everpark along with a recommendation from you. If you'd like to personalize this recommendation, go ahead and type what you want in the box provided below. We "recommend" you put something in, that way this email won't just be deleted and thought of as spam-mail. Anyways, we'll stop rambling and let you do your stuff.</p>

<p><strong>If you would like to send multiple emails at once, enter the email addresses seperated by commas (,).</strong></p>
