The purpose of this petition is to show to sponsors that the signers would like to have a better snowpark be built closer, cost much less than resorts, and support humanitarian programs. If the sponsors fund the 'eveRparks,' the entry prices could get under $10. Please sign the petition we call the "stoked list" and make it happen. Ride a better snowpark for less! eveRide.org
