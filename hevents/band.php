<h2>In a Band? Be heard!</h2>

<p><font class="blacktitle">we want to hear</font> <font class="bluetitle">your band</font></p>

<p>We dudes are all about good tunes, and want to hear your band! We want to see small local bands get bigger, and big not-so-local bands ... well... we just want to hear big not-so-local bands! We don't care if you play Polka or Death Metal, if you're down for the eveRide cause, we're down with you. Want to know more about our "softer" side? <a href="vc_f.php#hp">Click Here</a> to read about our Humanitarian  Goals and Programs. As Humans we have a lot more power to Help others than we realize.</p>
 
<p><font class="blacktitle">here's the</font> <font class="bluetitle">scoop</font></p>
 
<p>Register with us! We'll then inform you of shows your band can play at. We want to get a good list of bands on here so your music and our voice can be heard. It's all about recognition, and we figure the more shows you play at the more recognized you'll get, and we'll just set it up then mooch off your coolness.</p>

<p>Here's the catch (and if you don't like the sound of this your band is easily going down)... <i>we're not going to make any money off of these shows</i>, and neither are the bands. We're going to look for venues that will be down for the cause as you are, thus allowing us to rock for free, in the name of a great cause... because these shows will be about the CAUSE. Entrance fees won't be in dollar amounts, but rather cans of food, clothing, blankets, and stuff that could actually benefit somebody who's not as fortunate. So if you're down for the cause, go ahead and register! We want to hear you!</p>
