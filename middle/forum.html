<h2>So you want to get on our Online Forum?</h2>

<p>AWESOME! We need a lot of people to come to this site to view and post submissions, start conversations, and help us generate new ideas. Originally, we had the link you just clicked send someone straight to the Forum, but we've found people don't really know what to do when they get there. I'm working on getting some screen shots up so you can see exactly what you need to do. All the information I can think of is written below, so check that out if you get confused.</p>

<p><font class="blacktitle">how does it all</font> <font class="bluetitle">work?</font></p>

<p>The message board works a lot like a chat room, except without a streaming conversation. It's more like leaving a note on the counter for your mom to read, but anyone else in the house can read it too. People can reply to the subject you start with your post, or can create a new subject like you did. We currently only have one category (eveRide), and two forums (everpark, and humanitarian events) to which you can post, but the forums are located under the category (like a directory tree), so pretty much don't worry about the Category. So what does all that mean? Select either everpark, or humanitarian events to post a comment to. It's not as complicated as it seems, so play around with it, and <a href="tell_f.php">Tell a Friend</a> to go and sign up too.</p>

<p><font class="blacktitle">do I have to</font> <font class="bluetitle">register?</font></p>

<p>NO, you may post a comment anonymously. But if you want us to contact you with questions and maybe hook you up with some stuff, registering is quick, easy, and FREE way to do it.</p>

<p>For any other questions or concerns or whatever else, email me at <a href="mailto:webmaster@everide.org">webmaster@everide.org</a>, and I'll try and get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks, and enjoy the message board!</p>

<p><font class="blacktitle">how do I</font> <font class="bluetitle">post a comment?</font></p>

<p>Once you get to the Forum, click on the Register link located center top of the main forum page. From there you need to input just the regular information, and once you're signed up, you can post as many comments as you want.</p>
