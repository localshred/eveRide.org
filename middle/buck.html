<h2>no public info available for everpark Beta Project... YET.</h2>

<p>The beta project is going to rock. It's invite-only, so unless you're a friend, a pro, a sponsor, or some kind of mega-babe, you'll probably just drool over the pictures we'll put up in winter '03. Hopefully the project will get pros and sponsors excited for the future of eveRide and the everparks.</p>
