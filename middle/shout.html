<p><font style="color: #1a5c8a; font-weight: bold">Tim</font> - Thanks go out to Tim at Sign Pro for the good deals and good times. We'll be buying him dinner for the rest of our natural lives.</p>

<p><font style="color: #1a5c8a; font-weight: bold">Our Reps</font> - This probably sounds ultra gay-sappy, but we LOVE our Reps! They do more for us than we could have ever thought would be possible. eveRide is growing daily thanks 100% to them. If we could, we'd marry each one... or something to that effect. Most likely we'll be buying them dinner for the rest of our natural lives too. eveRide is what it is today, thanks to them. Thanks guys (and girls), you ROCK!</p>
