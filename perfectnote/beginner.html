  <p><strong>Is this for me?</strong></p>

  <p style="text-indent: 25px">Our Beginner Lessons are offered for students who 
    have never picked up a Guitar, or for students who are just trying to get 
    down the basics. If you know a few Chords, or just trying to get down your 
    strumming, these lessons are for you. For instance, if you only know around 
    four or five chords, and struggle with getting the strumming down, these lessons 
    are perfect for you. Our Instructors are willing to help students at all levels 
    of playing to understand the basics of playing the Guitar.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What if I'm not sure about beginner lessons?</strong></p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 25px">If you have been signed up for beginner lessons and feel that you aren't 
    progressing, we can easily move you to the Intermediate course. Also, if the 
    Instructor feels that your skill is above the Beginner Level, you will have 
    the option to jump to the Intermediate Lessons.</p>
