  <p><strong>Group Lessons</strong></p>

  <p style="text-indent: 25px">All of our Group Lessons run on a six week schedule. Classes are once per week, starting either on Tuesday or Thursday, and run for 1 hour. For instance, if you signed up for the Tuesday Class, you would then come every week on Tuesday at the specified time. There will never be over 20 students in one Group Lesson.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Private Lessons</strong></p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 25px">When you sign up for a Private Lesson, you're four week session begins on a either a Tuesday or Thursday. Classes are only once per week, so if you signed up for a Tuesday Class, your classes would be every week on Tuesday for Four Weeks. Classes are a half hour long and begin either at 7:45 or 8:30. When signing up please specify which date and time you would like to have your classes on. You will need to check our Class Schedule to see if the date you would like to sign up for is open. All dates and times are open unless otherwise stated on our <a href="../schedule.php" target="_new">Class Schedule</a>.</p>
