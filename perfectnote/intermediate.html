  <p><strong>Is this for me?</strong></p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 25px">Intermediate Lessons are designed for students 
    who have played the guitar, are used to strumming and understand basic chord 
    progression. For instance, if you know around six or seven songs, and feel 
    comfortable with your overall playing , these lessons are for you. Perfect 
    Note has created these lessons for people who want to continue their progression 
    and learn different styles of playing.</p>
	  
	
  <p><strong>I want to excel!</strong></p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 25px">This class is also designed for students who are 
    at a stand still in their current skills, or are struggling with certain strumming 
    patterns, picking patterns, or just overall songs.</p>
