  <p><strong>Class Info:</strong></p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 25px">Private Lessons are offered for students who would 
    like a one on one atmosphere. The Instructor will focus mainly on what the 
    student wants to learn, and will be able to help them develop their playing 
    more fully. During a Private Lesson, the Instructor will be able to adapt 
    to the students learning speed. Also, our ways of teaching will be centered 
    around the students progression, building on their strengths, and working 
    on their weaknesses.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 25px">Private Lessons are centered around the student, therefore we are willing 
    to work with other dates or times that will be easier for the student. However, 
    if at all possible, we would like to keep to our preferred dates which are 
    set in the <a href="javascript: send_url('schedule.php');">Class Schedules</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 25px">Perfect Note Instructors can teach Private Lessons 
    either in our regular classroom, or if the student requests, we can teach 
    them in a more convenient area (Home, School, etc.). We understand that some 
    students will not be able to get to our classroom, for whatever reason, thus 
    we are willing to drive to them. For our Instructor to drive to your specific 
    location, we will add $5 to the Lesson Price.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Specific Location:</strong> $50</li>
  <li><strong>Classroom:</strong> $45</li>
  </ul>
